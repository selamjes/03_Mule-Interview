1. mulesoft
- mule soft provides integration platform,  its light weight but highly scalable. also its Java based. Mule enables the reuse of component

2. ESB? the run time engine of anypoint platform
- (enterprise service bus) and integration platform.it helps for devloper can
 connect ther application with esb.including jms,web service,http etc

3. RAML?
-stands for restful api modeling launguage
- it containes end point url,request/response,http methods, query & uri parameters.
-raml can also used for documentation purpose
-it help for the client to know (a consumer of service) know what the service is and what how all operations can be invoked.

4. trait?
it used to define commen attributs for http method which is get, post, put, delete

5. dataType?
- allow the user to define objects and reuse them at any level in a RAML file.

6. security scheme
-security that would be used to secure the api and it its method.

7. resourceType
-It basically focuses on describing your API resources, methods, parameters, media type etc.

8. Error handling
Mule 4 error handling framework directly handles the exception
errorhandling types
	1. mule default
	2. application level
	3. global error handling
	4. flow level
	
error handling mechanisms
	1. error continue - On-Error Continue catches the error and does not report it as an error
	2. error propagate -  On-Error Propagate processes the error message and re-throws the error to its parent flow
	3. try catch scope - we can put our component in the try block.

9. Munit
-MUnit is a Mule Application Testing Framework that allows you to easily build automated tests for your Integration and APIs.

10. Domian
- implemented to configure the resources that are shared among different projects.
- Domain Project is used to create shared resources, which can reuse across other projects who are referring to domain projects

11. API
- (Application Programming Interface)which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other

12. API led conectivity
- It is an integration approach for connecting and exposing assets through reusable and purposeful APIs.
three types of API. system API, Process API Experienced API.
-Drive outcomes with Api led connectivity
. on time and within budget
. drives rules vs build
. designs in readiness for change
. builds in governance, compliance, security and scalability
. meets the needs of your business

C4E  center for enablement.(central IT, LOB, Developers) C4E is a cross functional team. C4E ENSURES that assets are - - productized and published
- consumable
- consumed broadly
- fully leveraged
. Success of C4E measured on assets consumption

13. An API proxy is an application that controls access to a web service,
restricting access and usage through the use of an API gateway

14.  The API Gateway is a runtime designed and optimized to host an API
or to open a connection to an API deployed to another runtime

15. types of flow
- flow both synchronous and a synchronous, with resource, it has error handling 
- sub flow:is always synchronous, no error handling 
- a synchronous flow: same as subflow the only differece 
- synchronous flow:

16. DataWeave
-. DataWeave is a MuleSoft tool for accessing and transforming data.
17. tramsformer
-are simple objects that convert the current message from one type to another.

18. API life cycle:  
-
19. Router in Mule
-Routers (Flow Controls in Anypoint Studio) 

20. Api kit router 

21. Endpoint in Mule
An endpoint is a flow-level element that is configured to receive and/or send messages from and/or to external resources. 
-
22. scatter Gather
-is a routing message processor in Mule ESB runtime that sends a request message to multiple targets concurrently.
