1. mulesoft
- mule soft provides integration platform,  its light weight but highly scalable. also its Java based. Mule enables the reuse of component

2. ESB? the run time engine of anypoint platform
- (enterprise service bus) and integration platform.it helps for devloper can connect ther application with esb.including jms,web service,http etc
3. RAML?
-stands for restful api modeling launguage
- it containes end point url,request/response,http methods, query & uri parameters.
-raml can also used for documentation purpose
-it help for the client to know (a consumer of service) know what the service is and what how all operations can be invoked.

4. trait?
it used to define commen attributs for http method which is get, post, put, delete
5. dataType?
- allow the user to define objects and reuse them at any level in a RAML file.
6. security scheme
-security that would be used to secure the api and it its method.
7. resourceType
-It basically focuses on describing your API resources, methods, parameters, media type etc.
8. Error handling
Mule 4 error handling framework directly handles the exception
errorhandling types
	1. mule default
	2. application level
	3. global error handling
	4. flow level
	
error handling mechanisms
	1. error continue - On-Error Continue catches the error and does not report it as an error
	2. error propagate -  On-Error Propagate processes the error message and re-throws the error to its parent flow
	3. try catch scope - we can put our component in the try block.

9. Munit
-MUnit is a Mule Application Testing Framework that allows you to easily build automated tests for your Integration and APIs.
10. Domian
- implemented to configure the resources that are shared among different projects.
- Domain Project is used to create shared resources, which can reuse across other projects who are referring to domain projects

11. API
- (Application Programming Interface)which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other
12. API led conectivity
- It is an integration approach for connecting and exposing assets through reusable and purposeful APIs.
three types of API. system API, Process API Experienced API.

13. ApI Proxy
-An API proxy is your interface to developers that want to use your backend services.
14. Api Getway
-An API gateway is an API management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services. 
15. types of flow
- flow both synchronous and a synchronous, with resource, it had error handling 
- sub flow:is always synchronous, no error handling 
- a synchronous flow: same as subflow the only differece
- synchronous flow:

16. DataWeave
-. DataWeave is a MuleSoft tool for accessing and transforming data.
17. tramsformer
-are simple objects that convert the current message from one type to another.
