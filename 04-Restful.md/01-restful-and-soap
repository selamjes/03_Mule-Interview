1. Advantages of RESTful Web Services
Fast: RESTful Web Services are fast because there is no strict specification like
SOAP. It consumes less bandwidth and resource.

2. SOAP Web Service?
- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is  XML-based protocol
for accessing web services.
-  SOAP web services can be written in any programming language and executed in any platform.
- WSDL dependent: SOAP uses WSDL and doesn’t have any other mechanism to
discover the service.

SOAP -> REST
1. SOAP is a protocol. -> REST is an architectural style.
2. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. -> REST stands for
REpresentational State Transfer.
3. SOAP can’t use REST because it is a protocol. -> REST can use SOAP web services
because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP
